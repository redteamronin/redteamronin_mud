# Changelog

## v6.2 - Collapsible Shop (Current)
**Date:** 2025-02-19

### Major UX Improvement:
- 🎯 **Collapsible Shop Panel** - Click to expand/collapse
- Shop now starts collapsed by default
- Auto-collapses when any action is taken
- Prevents shop from blocking important game info
- Much better mobile experience

### How It Works:
- Shop header is always visible when discovered
- Click header to toggle shop inventory open/closed
- Arrow indicator shows state (▶ collapsed, ▼ expanded)
- Any action (attack, search, move, etc.) auto-collapses shop
- Keeps character stats, location, and combat visible

### Why This Matters:
- Shop with 12 items is ~1500px tall
- Was blocking character HP, enemy status, combat log
- Players couldn't see if they were dying
- Mobile users had to scroll constantly
- Now: Shop is there when you need it, hidden when you don't

### Files Changed:
- `src/mud-terminal.jsx` - Added shopVisible state, collapsible UI, auto-collapse
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

## v6.1 - UX Improvements
**Date:** 2025-02-19

### UX Improvements:
- 📜 **Auto-scroll to top** after all actions (attack, flee, rest, search, move, shop)
- Keeps character info, location, and status visible
- Smooth scroll animation
- Better gameplay flow, especially with large shop panels

### Why This Matters:
- Shop panel is tall and pushes important info off-screen
- Players need to see HP, enemy status, and combat log
- Manual scrolling after every action is tedious
- Improves mobile experience significantly

### Files Changed:
- `src/mud-terminal.jsx` - Added gameTopRef and scrollToTop() function
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file
